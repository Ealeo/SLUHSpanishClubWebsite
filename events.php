<h5>Mr. James Page, S.J. is a Jesuit scholastic who is now doing his Regency at St. Louis University High School, where he will be teaching for the next few years. He has an undergraduate degree in Economics from Pomona College, and has just recently finished his graduate studies in Philosophy at the University of Toronto, where he spent most of his time studying the intersection between phenomenology and inter-religious dialogue. He grew up speaking both English and Spanish, as his mother's family is from A Coruna: as a result he has a lively interest in all things Spanish and Latin American, and will be a welcome presence in Spanish Club.</h5>
