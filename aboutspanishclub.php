<h3>The Saint Louis University High School Spanish Club was disbanded at the end of the 2014-2015 school year. Fortunately, in September of 2015, the club was formed again. It is now headed by two new faculty moderators, Sra. Alvarado and Mr. Page, and a new president, Eric Schnelker. After recruiting new members, the new Spanish Club went on to host a movie night, eat at two different Mexican restaurants, celebrate Cinco de Mayo with a party during Activity Period, and attend the Festival of Nations in August of 2016. We are looking forward to organizing many more &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events.</h3>

<h5>Mr. James Page, S.J. is a Jesuit scholastic who is now doing his Regency at St. Louis University High School, where he will be teaching for the next few years. He has an undergraduate degree in Economics from Pomona College, and has just recently finished his graduate studies in Philosophy at the University of Toronto, where he spent most of his time studying the intersection between phenomenology and inter-religious dialogue. He grew up speaking both English and Spanish, as his mother's family is from A Coruna: as a result he has a lively interest in all things Spanish and Latin American, and will be a welcome presence in Spanish Club.</h5>
